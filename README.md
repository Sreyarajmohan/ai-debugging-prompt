# AI Debugging Prompt for FOSSEE Internship

This repository contains my submission for the AI Debugging Assistant internship task by FOSSEE.

## Files Included

- ai_debug_prompt.md: The AI prompt designed to guide the assistant in helping students debug Python code.
- reasoning.md: Explanation of the approach, tone, and adaptability of the prompt.
- design_choices.md: The reasoning behind key decisions made while crafting the prompt.

## Purpose

The goal of this prompt is to help students identify bugs in their Python code by receiving hints and questions from the AI without giving away direct answers. The assistant encourages critical thinking and adapts to the learner’s level.
