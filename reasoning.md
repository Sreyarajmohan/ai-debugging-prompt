# Reasoning for AI Debugging Assistant Prompt Design

## Tone and Style

The AI should be friendly, patient, and encouraging to create a positive learning environment. It must avoid sounding judgmental or harsh to keep students motivated.

## Balance between Bug Identification and Guidance

The AI must carefully identify bugs but avoid giving direct answers. Instead, it should guide students with questions and hints, promoting critical thinking and learning.

## Adapting for Different Skill Levels

For beginners, the AI should use simple language and provide gentle hints. For advanced students, it can use technical terms and ask deeper questions to challenge their understanding.

This approach helps make the debugging assistant useful for a wide range of students and encouragesÂ self-learning.
